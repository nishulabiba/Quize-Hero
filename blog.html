              Question 1: What is the difference between map(), filter(), forEach and find() ?

          filter() and map() return a new collection, find() returns a single element, and foreach() returns nothing but allows an operation to be performed on each element in the collection. But I think the map() and filter() has advantages over for() and foreach().

          Advantages:
          
          No need to write too much of code and very clear understanding and better performance compare to iteration.

              <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
